# CSS Real Estate

This repo is a recreation of [Lalu Husni Hawari](https://dribbble.com/shots/23462984-RUWAH-Real-Estate-Landing-Page)'s Dribbble design for a real estate website. The project was implemented with React using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. For this project I did not have access to the Figma or any of the used fonts/images, as such, some elements are close replications.

Additionally, there is no responsive/mobile design provided, so I implemented my own.
